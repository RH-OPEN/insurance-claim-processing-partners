= Information Extraction
include::_attributes.adoc[]

As part of our claim processing, we want to extract some information from the text of a claim. In the next notebook we will investigate how the LLM can be used to do this task.

From the `insurance-claim-processing/lab-materials/03` folder, please open the notebook called `03-03-information-extraction.ipynb` and follow the instructions.

Kindly note that we are using cpus instead of gpus and so output rendered from LLM will be little slower than expected, but the focus is more on the functionality and what can be achieved from OpenShift AI. Please note that you will take atleast 2 to 4 mints to get output from LLM per claim.

When done, you can close the notebook and head to the next page.
